# AutoResponder - AI Assistant Test Results

## Original User Problem Statement
Create a Personalized AI assistant that can listen to video/audio calls and respond on screen in real-time like a conversation. There should be a button when clicked agent should listen and respond in real time when released. Should be able to listen long up to 30sec of conversation and respond like interviewer asking questions and the agent responding in real-time on screen.

Features needed:
- Connect to all available LLM providers like OpenAI, Groq, Perplexity, Claude, Ollama etc
- User option to select any provider and add API key
- Multi-turn conversation memory of last 5 interactions for context
- Agent should run on local machine with auto setup for both Windows and Linux

## Testing Protocol
- Test backend functionality using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- Ask user permission before testing frontend
- Update this file after each testing cycle
- Never fix issues already resolved by testing agents

## Tasks Completed
- Project initialization started
- Planning phase completed

## Current Status
- Setting up basic project structure
- Need to implement audio processing, LLM integrations, and real-time communication

## Next Steps
1. Set up FastAPI backend with WebSocket support
2. Set up React frontend with audio recording
3. Implement speech-to-text integration
4. Add multiple LLM provider support
5. Create conversation memory system
